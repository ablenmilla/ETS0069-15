# set method
1. add() Method

The add() method is used to add a single element to a set. If the element already exists in the set, it won't be added again because sets do not allow duplicates.



# clear() Method

The clear() method removes all elements from a set, leaving it empty. It does not delete the set itself, just clears its contents.

# copy() Method

The copy() method creates a shallow copy of a set. This means it makes a new set with the same elements, but it's a separate object in memory. Changing one will not affect the other.
