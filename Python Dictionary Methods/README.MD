# dictionary methods

# clear
The clear() method removes all items from a dictionary, leaving it empty. It doesn't delete the dictionary itself, just erases all key-value pairs inside it.

# copy
The copy() method creates a shallow copy of the dictionary, meaning changes to the copied dictionary wonâ€™t affect the original (unless it contains nested objects like lists or other dictionaries).

# fromkeys
The fromkeys() method creates a new dictionary using a given sequence of keys, assigning the same specified value to each key in the new dictionary.
