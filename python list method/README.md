# append
The append() method is used to add a new item to the end of a list. It does not replace any existing elements but simply expands the list by one item. This method is useful when you want to keep adding data without modifying the original elements. For example, if you have a list of fruits and want to add "cherry" to it, you can use append().





# clear
The clear() method removes all elements from a list, making it completely empty. The list itself still exists, but it will have no items inside. This is helpful when you no longer need the data in the list and want to reset it. Imagine wiping a whiteboard clean—it's still there, but everything on it is gone.









# copy
The copy() method creates a duplicate of a list. This is useful when you want to work with the same data but avoid modifying the original list. If you make changes to the copied list, the original remains unchanged. Think of it like making a photocopy of a document—writing on the copy doesn’t change the original.
